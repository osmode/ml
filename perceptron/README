This program demonstrates a very simple perceptron learning algorithm.
First a line is randomly drawn in a [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] space.
Then N points (the first parameter of function main) are randomly generated
and assigned a value of either -1 or 1 by the target function depending
on whether or not they fall above or below the line. The PLA iterates
num_exp times (the second paramter of function main), and during each
iteration the weight vector is adjusted as W:= W + y_n'*X, where w is the
weight vector, y_n is the transverse of a vector consisting of the output 
of the target function, and X is a vector consisting of input points (i.e.
vector X = [x0; x1; x2] where x0 = 1.

To run, enter the following commands:
octave
source coordinates.m
source main.m
main(10,1)

The first parameter of main is N. The second parameter is the number 
of experiments to run.
