NN.py is a simple demonstration of the pybrain library
(www.pybrain.org). A deep neural network is learned using the
MNIST digits (downloaded from the Kaggle Digit Recognition 
competition website, which has these data as csv files). Then
the test data are fed into the neural network in order to make
digit predictions.

This code intentionally does not make use of python's csv
function library and is written simplistically in order
to keep the focus on the pybrain library, especially the
data set classes, which might throw off new pybrain users.

This is an example of classification and classification data sets.
Pybrain is a great library that can do much more, so check it 
out as well as the official documentation.
